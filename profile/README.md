## Vision  

At Fisor Analytics, our vision is to empower Canadian businesses with the same caliber of insights and tools typically reserved for large enterprises.  

We believe that **mid-sized companies** (50‚Äì500 employees, $2M+ revenue) are the backbone of the economy, yet often lack access to advanced analytics due to high costs, technical barriers, and siloed data.  

Our goal is to close that gap by delivering:  
- **Enterprise-grade analytics at SME scale** ‚Äì affordable, modular, and easy to adopt  
- **Predictive intelligence, not just reporting** ‚Äì turning raw data into actionable foresight  
- **A trusted Canadian platform** ‚Äì secure, privacy-focused, and built with local needs in mind  

Ultimately, we aim to become the **‚ÄúPalantir of Canada‚Äù**: a partner that enables organizations to see further, decide smarter, and grow sustainably.
